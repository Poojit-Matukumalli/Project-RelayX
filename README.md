## - Project RelayX -

***Built for Privacy, Funded by You.***

If you are interested in setting up a RelayX of your own, check out [SETUP.md](SETUP.md)

## Overview :

RelayX is a *desktop messaging platform* designed for *maximum privacy and security*, combining Tor networking with modern cryptography and a lightweight Flutter UI.

Key highlights:
- Anonymous multi-hop messaging through Tor relays.
- X25519-based key exchange and HKDF session keys for secure communication.
- Signed messages and timestamping to prevent replays.
- Asynchronous communication for smooth UX.
- Minimal metadata storage—your privacy, always.

---

## Architecture

- *Frontend:* Flutter desktop app (Windows/Linux).  
- *Backend:* Python FastAPI server handling user management, encryption, and routing.  
- *Cryptography:* X25519 DH handshake, Fernet encryption, digital signatures, AESCGM, HKDF.  
- *Persistence:* SQLite database via SQLAlchemy for user and message storage.

---

## Features :

- *Anonymous Messaging:* Messages route through multiple Tor relays and Multiple user set-up RelayX relay servers
- *Secure Key Management:* Each user has a signature public key; session keys derived securely.  
- *Replay Protection:* Messages are signed and timestamped.  
- *Email Integration:* New users receive signature public keys via email automatically.  
- *Cross-Platform Desktop:* Flutter UI runs on Windows, Linux, and Android.  
- *Zero Metadata:* No unnecessary user info stored; privacy-first approach.
