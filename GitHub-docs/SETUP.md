# Relay Setup (Important)
Requirements :
1. A PC w/ Linux (Ubuntu server distro)
2. Low level (Bare metal) Knowledge systems (Because something is bound to break)

If you're planning on setting up a RelayX, visit our second repository.
We created a second repo, which is completely dedicated to the relay software and details about how to setup.

That repo contains everything you need, Including README.md, RELAYSETUP.md and a bash file for installing the RelayX. Please read them carefully before starting the setup.
